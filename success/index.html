    <td width="89%" colspan="2" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p>Our lives are full of so many different facets that make up the person we are. No two sides of a diamond in the rough are the same, and that is an apt description of us as people and the lives we choose to lead. </p>
      <p>Some of the events in our lives are happy and joyful, such as the birth of a child, a new friend to see a circus with, or the release of a new, long anticipated book. </p>
      <p> Some of the happenings in our lives are learning opportunities such as a college course, a high school graduation, a new sport learned, knowing that one can walk on fire or even participating in a dance recital. </p>
      <p>Some of the upheavals in our lives are challenges, which can be as small as learning to tie a shoe, or buttering the right side of your toast, to as big or even as massively big as buying a house, illnesses, losing a dear friend, an argument with a spouse or needing to bury a parent.</p>
      <p>These types of occurrences happen to all of us. Every single one of us.</p>
      <p> None of us are victims, we all volunteered to be here, to LIVE. We cannot escape this, we cannot escape our lives, we cannot escape that.. well sometimes great things happen to bad people, and bad things sometimes happen to great people. And, what is really nice, sometimes great things happen to great people, and bad things happen to nasty people!</p>
      <p>I wrote this section with the hopes that some will gain insights from the inspirations here, and that some will also gain comfort. There are times when we can feel very isolated and alone with our personal demons that no one else understands, or so we can think. My wish is that all of those who feel that way, learn that they really aren't alone, and more people &quot;get it&quot; than they realize! </p>
      <p>So.. within this section is a bit of a story of the challenges I've faced and overcome, some of the inspirations that were helpful to me, ideas that helped me keep my head screwed on straight! Add to this mix, a fantastic family, and a wonderful pile of friends that are there for me, have listened to me in some really dark times and lent me their shoulders, and sometimes gave me the proverbial boot in the ass. :-) Without them, they who are lifesavers, I know I wouldn't be where I am now. Thank you to every one of you, and you all know who you are. </p>
      <p>Namaste!<br />
