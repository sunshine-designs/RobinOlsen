    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><h3><a name="daffodil" id="daffodil"></a>The Daffodils</h3>
      <p>Several times my daughter had telephoned to say, &quot;Mother, you must come see the   daffodils before they are over.&quot; I wanted to go, but it was a two-hour drive   from Laguna to Lake Arrowhead. &quot;I will come next Tuesday,&quot; I promised, a little   reluctantly, on her third call.<br />
        <br />
        Next Tuesday dawned cold and rainy.   Still, I had promised, and so I drove there. When I finally walked into   Carolyn's house and hugged and greeted my grandchildren, I said, &quot;Forget the   daffodils, Carolyn! The road is invisible in the clouds and fog, and there is   nothing in the world except you and these children that I want to see bad enough   to drive another inch!&quot;<br />
        <br />
        My daughter smiled calmly and said, &quot;We drive in   this all the time, Mother.&quot; &quot;Well, you won't get me back on the road until it   clears, and then I'm heading for home!&quot; I assured her.<br />
        <br />
&quot;I was hoping   you'd take me over to the garage to pick up my car.&quot; &quot;How far will we have to   drive?&quot; &quot;Just a few blocks,&quot; Carolyn said. &quot;I'll drive. I'm used to   this.&quot;<br />
<br />
After several minutes, I had to ask, &quot;Where are we going? This   isn't the way to the garage!&quot; &quot;We're going to my garage the long way,&quot; Carolyn   smiled, &quot;by way of the daffodils.&quot; &quot;Carolyn,&quot; I said sternly, &quot;please turn   around.&quot; &quot;It's all right, Mother, I promise. You will never forgive yourself if   you miss this experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
After about twenty minutes, we turned onto a   small gravel road and I saw a small church. On the far side of the church, I saw   a hand lettered sign that read, &quot;Daffodil Garden.&quot; We got out of the car and   each took a child's hand, and I followed Carolyn down the path.<br />
<br />
Then, we   turned a corner of the path, and I looked up and gasped. Before me lay the most   glorious sight. It looked as though someone had taken a great vat of gold and   poured it down over the mountain peak and slopes. The flowers were planted in   majestic, swirling patterns great ribbons and swaths of deep orange, white,   lemon yellow, salmon pink, saffron, and butter yellow.<br />
<br />
Each different   colored variety was planted as a group so that it swirled and flowed like its   own river with its own unique hue. There were five acres of flowers.<br />
<br />
&quot;But   who has done this?&quot; I asked Carolyn. &quot;It's just one woman,&quot; Carolyn answered.   &quot;She lives on the property. That's her home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carolyn pointed to a   well-kept frame house that looked small and modest in the midst of all that   glory. We walked up to the house. On the patio, we saw a poster. &quot;Answers to the   Questions I Know You Are Asking&quot; was the headline.<br />
<br />
The first answer was a   simple one. &quot;50,000 bulbs,&quot; it read. The second answer was, &quot;One at a time, by   one woman. Two hands, two feet, and very little brain.&quot; The third answer was,   &quot;Began in 1958.&quot; There it was, The Daffodil Principle.<br />
<br />
For me, that   moment was a life changing experience. I thought of this woman whom I had never   met, who, more than forty years before, had begun one bulb at a time-to bring   her vision of beauty and joy to an obscure mountain top. Still, just planting   one bulb at a time, year after year, had changed the world.<br />
<br />
This unknown   woman had forever changed the world in which she lived. She had created   something of ineffable (indescribable) magnificence, beauty, and inspiration.   The principle her daffodil garden taught is one of the greatest principles of   celebration. That is, learning to move toward our goals and desires one step at   a time often just one baby step at a time-and learning to love the doing,   learning to use the accumulation of time.<br />
<br />
When we multiply tiny pieces of   time with small increments of daily effort, we too will find we can accomplish   magnificent things. We can change the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;It makes me sad in a way,&quot;   I admitted to Carolyn. &quot;What might I have accomplished if I had thought of a   wonderful goal thirty-five or forty years ago and had worked away at it 'one   bulb at a time' through all those years. Just think what I might have been able   to achieve!&quot;<br />
<br />
My daughter summed up the message of the day in her usual   direct way.<br />
&quot;Start tomorrow,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
It's so pointless to think of   the lost hours of yesterdays. The way to make learning a lesson of celebration   instead of a cause for regret is to only ask, &quot;How can I put this to use today?&quot; <br />

        <br />
May you find serenity and tranquility<br />
in a   world you may not always understand. <br />
<br />
May the pain you have known <br />
and   the conflict you have experienced <br />
give you the strength to walk through life <br />
facing each new situation with courage and optimism. <br />
<br />
Always know   that there are those<br />
whose love and understanding will always be   there,<br />
even when you feel most alone. <br />
<br />
May a kind word,<br />
a   reassuring touch,<br />
and a warm smile <br />
be yours every day of your life, <br />
and may you give these gifts<br />
as well as receive them.<br />
May the   teachings of those you admire<br />
become part of you,<br />
so that you may call   upon them. <br />
<br />
Remember, those whose lives you have touched<br />
and who have   touched yours are always a part of you,<br />
even if the encounters were less than   you <br />
would have wished. It is the content of the encounter <br />
That is more   important than its form. <br />
<br />
May you not become too concerned   with<br />
material matters, but instead place immeasurable value<br />
on the   goodness in your heart.<br />
Find time in each day to see beauty and love<br />
in   the world around you. <br />
<br />
Realize that what you feel you lack in one   regard<br />
you may be more than compensated for in another.<br />
What you feel you   lack in the present<br />
may become one of your strengths in the future. <br />
<br />
May you see your future as one filled <br />
with promise and possibility. <br />
Learn to view everything as a worthwhile experience. <br />
<br />
May you find   enough inner strength<br />
to determine your own worth by yourself,<br />
and not be   dependent on another's judgment <br />
of your accomplishments. <br />
<br />
May you   always feel loved. <br />
These Are My Wishes For You </p>

      <p align="center"><strong>Be a   Lantern</strong></p>
      <p>Today, think of yourself as a lantern whose   job it is to share light.&nbsp; Think of yourself as a lantern poised over the   pathway, showing others the way.&nbsp; Think of yourself as a lantern hanging over   the sign to the inn, showing people where they may come to get sustenance, rest   and shelter.&nbsp; Think of yourself as a lantern held so high, that you light an   entire field, so that people may begin their work early and stay in the fields   until after dark, planting the seeds for a new world.</p>
      <p>And where is this lantern to be found, this   lantern to light the world?&nbsp; It is within you.&nbsp; It is in your smile, in your   reassuring voice, in your laughter, in the light within your eyes, in the love   that pours from your heart.&nbsp; It is in your ears as you listen for the truth   under the words, then take that truth and lift it up so that it can shine.&nbsp; It   is the glow inside you, the glow that contains all of your inner beauty, your   talents, your wonder.</p>
      <p>You are the lantern that can light up the   world.&nbsp; You are the bright spot in the darkness.&nbsp; You are the leader that can   step forward and show the way, simply by holding your love and truth high, high   enough to keep the darkness of fear and doubt away.&nbsp; You are the   light.</p>
      <p>And as you do this, as you smile and laugh   and encourage, as you hold out your hand and lift up, know that for each gesture   of love and light, you pull in the energies of the universe ten-thousand fold.&nbsp;   Each smile of yours lightens the hearts of many.&nbsp; Each act of love and kindness   is multiplied many times over and spreads out like the rings from a pebble   tossed into a lake.&nbsp; And even if all you do is shine by thinking and feeling   love and compassion, high energy and light, then this too, lightens the world   and helps beyond measure.</p>
      <p>Decide today to be on the side of light.&nbsp;   Realize that it is your job, your responsibility, as a person of light, to shine   as brightly as you possibly can.&nbsp; Be the lantern over the path, over the sign,   over the field, held high, showing the way.</p>
