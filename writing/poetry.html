I go through phases when they just emerge from my pen unbidden, often an expression of my feelings. Some of these are cute, some are less than 'sunshiny', some are the expressions of what I was feeling at the time that I wrote them. Sometimes they're &quot;no holds barred&quot;, but better to write the feelings out in a safe outlet than to have a nervous breakdown! I'd rather write than send my nerves into another state of oblivion. We all need those releases at times and my expressions are either through my written word or my artwork. </span><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Robincopyright.lbi" -->
