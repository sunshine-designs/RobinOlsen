      <p>Some people are talented and use their gifts in various ways... a singer gives the gift of his or her voice and creates beautiful music. The mathematician figures out the answer to the quadratic formula, or for the sheer perverse pleasure of it, beats the dealer at black jack more times than not. The artist 'sees' with his or her fingers, expressing what they visualize into a recognizable form or one that is the artist's interpretation, but remember neither is wrong or right! The accountant is the wizard with numbers and bookkeeping records and the tax laws of the IRS otherwise known as the Internal Revenue Service or Interminable Raping of Salaries or some other such colloquium. The chef makes the most mouth-watering meals or desserts, reminding us that we eat to live and when WAS the last time you ate?? I can think of dozens more analogies, but I think you can catch my drift! </p>
      <p>Me? I write, I think too much sometimes, write some more, type and and swear at my typos, and hope that someone really appreciates or understands what I might have to say and share that introspection with me.</p>
      <p>So.. I write. </p>
    <p>I write of human nature, feelings, and learning to not suppress them but to accept them. How it is that we have forgotten what's really important in our lives? I write of songs and tales and sad brave men and women, of the crystals below and above, the lessons I've seen and learned, wisdom earned, knowledge to share with the friends I've learned to care for, but most of all I write for me. </p>
