Perhaps they're rambling with a core statement that runs throughout that you &quot;get&quot; by the time you're done reading it. Maybe its just a nonsensical and whimsical diatribe that means nothing at all, but it did me at the time I wrote it! Enjoy... and opinions expressed here (this is my disclaimer now!) are solely mine. </p>

    <p class="style12">I&rsquo;m sitting here  realizing two things tonight.&nbsp; I was  sitting at the dinner table with Jenna and we&rsquo;re chatting as we are  eating.&nbsp; She was telling me about these  two guys at the BMSE this afternoon who asked her if she had been at the Earth  Spirits lecture the previous evening.&nbsp; At  the lecture, she&rsquo;d said she was able to see gnomes, fairies, elves and even the  unicorn horns on my and the presenters heads!&nbsp;  She&rsquo;s thrilled with the fact that she could see them and I didn&rsquo;t. (So  what if seeing auras/energy fields didn&rsquo;t count!)&nbsp; But, the important thing was that these two  young gentlemen were praising her for being so far ahead of so many others,  that it was a fantastic thing, she had a gift to share with the world.&nbsp; Ok, so I had to reassure her that didn&rsquo;t mean  that she HAD to do it and RIGHT N OW.&nbsp;  When the time is right, she&rsquo;ll know what she wants to do.&nbsp; We were talking about psychic abilities and  people being jaded.&nbsp; Well&hellip; that led to a  discussion of what &ldquo;jaded&rdquo; meant since she didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking  about!</p>
      <p class="style12">What I found  interesting as I was trying to explain &ldquo;jaded&rdquo; in terms that she could  understand keeping in mind that she, as a 10 yr old, really doesn&rsquo;t have enough  experiences to relate to that.&nbsp; I hit on  my job hunting experiences as a way of helping her relate, and sort of realized  as I&rsquo;m explaining &ldquo;jaded&rdquo; to her, that I have become pretty jaded myself when  it comes to the realm of job hunting and interviews.</p>
      <p class="style12">Hmm&hellip; after more  interviews and rejections than I can even count anymore, it sort of went off  like a light bulb in my mind that feeling jaded does and has probably affected  me during all those interviews. </p>
      <p class="style12">I suppose part of  it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be due to the fact that I really don&rsquo;t WANT to be doing  what I&rsquo;m doing anymore.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a tossup  between the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a check&rdquo; and the need to support myself and Jenna.</p>
      <p class="style12">And therein is the  next step.&nbsp; What is my core belief when  it comes to money?&nbsp; I was at the mall  today with Jenna, we&rsquo;re shopping and she talked (conned?) me into getting her  another bear from Build-A-Bear.&nbsp; Granted  it was a shamrock &ndash; i.e. Irish St. Paddy Day &ndash; bear, and she IS &frac14; Irish, so it  was cute.&nbsp; She was being Jenna and seeing  all these different things that were pretty cool that she wanted (and well, I  admit that massage chair at the one store WAS really neat, felt awesome &ndash; like  getting a massage, even if it didn&rsquo;t hit all the points that really works for  me.)<br />
        &nbsp; <br />
        I think I found  myself saying more no&rsquo;s than anything else, the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bank syndrome&rdquo;&hellip; and  thinking about that while reading Skye Thomas&rsquo;s newsletter which arrived in my  email today.&nbsp; It talked a bout those core  beliefs about money (synchronicity again!) that we often have.&nbsp; How were they instilled into us as  children?&nbsp; I think about that, how it was  sort of impressed on me that the &lsquo;money isn&rsquo;t always there unless you save it,  plan for it, the lack of &ldquo;having a pot to piss in&rdquo;, the depression, being in  control of where every penny goes, etc.&nbsp;  I could go on like that, and I realize as being a single parent with  more support going out than is coming in and well.. I have sort of adopted that  attitude that the money isn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp;  What&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;m realizing that I really don&rsquo;t want to pass it onto  Jenna, and she&rsquo;s got two parents who ARE preaching that.&nbsp; What I want to do is to think about that and  see how I can change this regarding Jenna.&nbsp;  I want her to think there is abundance everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking &lsquo;poverty consciousness&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t  spread that now, does it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a balance  between being conscious of the checkbook and the attitude that there IS  enough.&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        How does one  balance that? It certainly bears pondering&hellip; </p>

      <p class="style12">I pick up my variegated orange shaded candle in my hand and  lift it to my nose.&nbsp; I slowly breathe in its  sweet scent and turn it over to examine the base since I&rsquo;d forgotten what  creative name its maker had bestowed upon it.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Wild Magnolia&rdquo; it says simply, and I think to myself that yes it&rsquo;s a  suitable name for an unusual scent, even if I privately don&rsquo;t think it smells  like magnolias in the least!&nbsp; Actually, I  lied. It really says Wild Mandarin, which is a tangy citrusy scent reminding me  of summers and warm sunshine and lazy beach days where I can lounge around with  absolutely no cares in my world.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style12">&ldquo;OK&rdquo; I  think, I&rsquo;m picking up my red and silver lighter to click and click and OK so  this thing is almost empty of lighter fluid and CLICK and there is the flame  now. I hold it over the blackened and bent over candle wick which has obviously  been burnt before and smile in satisfaction as the flame flickers then catches  a hold of the wick tentatively at first then with strength to burn at a slow  and steady pace. Watching the flame is mesmerizing and I watch it glowing  orange and yellow which is orangey through its briefly flickering then steady  flame.&nbsp; It reaches long and high above  the wick, which is signaling to me silently that NO I failed in my duty to keep  that simple wick trimmed to a &lsquo;regulation&rsquo; &frac14; &ldquo; that would eliminate brown and  sooty smoke stains through my quiet house.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style12">Ask me if I have any fleeting worries about it&rsquo;s quiet and simple and  hidden dark desires within the flame.&nbsp; It  sits regally on top of my very over piled desk which is still crowded with  papers and I do quietly remember again why I religiously purchase candle  holders to catch any of those wayward drippings, though this candle is polite  and refuses to misbehave in that manner.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style12">The warm and simple flame brings back to me memories that have been  triggered of campfires of my long ago physical youth even though I am eternally  young.&nbsp; I remember tall bonfires in  various night time campgrounds surrounded by friends and smelly clothes complete  with swollen and crispy brown and warm sweet marshmallows on long brittle  sticks.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style12">It remember those fondly, and I  remember another blazingly hot bonfire a little more than what seems like a  lifetime ago but yet a year ago in someone&rsquo;s backyard where I literally walked  through the bonfire of my soul.&nbsp; It was  symbolic of a simple but profound lesson that I would learn that dark night,  even as I was surrounded by a ring of people, I gazed deeply alone into that  mesmerizing burning pile of newspaper and logs.&nbsp;The words that rang through my head, which I truly understood later were  simple, short and to the point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because  I Can&rdquo; another woman had said to me when I questioned her for what seemed to me  at the time an incomprehensible reason for walking on fire.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style12">Why was I choosing to limit myself?&nbsp; Telling myself in a certain way that I could  not, impossible, never ever do such a brash and stupid thing &ndash; ME? Walk on  FIRE?&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you underSTAND?&nbsp; My legs don&rsquo;t always do their simple bidding,  but argue with me when I say MOVE and they would respond in their usual  stubbornly sluggish way.&nbsp; How dare I  consider such an impossible task? Walking on a hot bed of coals called  fire?&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style12">I remember with a smile the  lessons I learned deep within myself that night, and remember the exhilaration  of overcoming my own unbiased fears and remembering that it truly IS all about  what one&rsquo;s mind considers the cold hard facts which can really represent  themselves as fancy illusions.&nbsp; I choose  to not argue for my limitations, for I would rather put them down, and reach  out with brave and sometimes scared hands to reach for the golden ring in the  sky.</p>
      <p class="style12">And it&rsquo;s a simple flame that stares back at me this dark and  calm quiet night.</p>
