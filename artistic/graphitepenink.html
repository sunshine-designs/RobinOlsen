    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><p class="eagle">Pen and Ink is a new medium to me that I am beginning to explore along with my usual drawings in Graphite and Charcoal. I am finding that I am drawing &quot;looser&quot; with the pen, and that is probably a good thing since it's not &quot;erasable&quot;! Less of the perfectionist tendency with that, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has been reminding me that my &quot;imperfect&quot; sketching is a lot like life. What IS perfection anyway? Is it the meticulous attention to detail, or is it what life IS?</p>
    <p>What I have found that has been new has been drawing the human form - Me draw people??!! I never thought I would do that, and if this isn't an example of &quot;never say never&quot;, I don't know what is. It's something for me to experiment further with.</p>
    <p align="left">Sometimes - sometimes it's been a bit of a paradigm shift to redefine &quot;perfect&quot;. I think that perhaps <em>everything</em> is perfect in its own unique way... and by looking at art from that different viewpoint, how can any of it be wrong?</p>
    <p>How can any of US be wrong? We are all &quot;right&quot; for ourselves, we are all on our own individual paths in our lives doing the best we can! </p>
    <p class="eagle">I  love the animal kingdom. That is very evident by all sorts of creatures that have traveled their way through my house, some temporarily and some on a more permanent basis for as long as they give me the gift of their presence. </p>
    <p class="eagle">There is a certain connection to nature that all creatures have, and there are times when I can simply sit and FEEL their spirit. Their eyes, like the humanoid versions, speak volumes. A certain strength and purpose to just live in the moment shine through, and it's certainly something that I can learn from! Words cannot express what they say but I can see their essence when I take the time to look. </p>

Most of the time, after sketching my outlines and gross details, the first thing I focus on are their eyes. They come to life, and my art develops a life of it's own, and the rest of the picture follows through naturally! Their essence speaks tome, encouraging me to bring their form into existence. </span></p>
      <p>Their eyes are windows to the soul...</p>
