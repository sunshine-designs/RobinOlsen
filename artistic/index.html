    <td rowspan="2"><p>Art is my vision, or I could say that my vision is my art. I draw, paint and create what I see, then I go beyond to express what IS. Paradoxical? Perhaps, and perhaps not. </p>
      <p>Where does our light come from? As much of the light and sun that I am, the light shines from within us all, in all that is around us be it of the rock, the fire, the air or the sea. We experience all of our lives, with its ups and downs, positives and negatives, joys and sadness, and we come to understand that without the one, the other could not exist. Opposites must be embraced and integrated into a whole entity of being.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly its not always that easy to do for many!</p>
      <p>No matter.. what does matter is that we all do the best we can in everything we do at the moment that we are dong it, and that we have fun with our life as it is.</p>
      <p>What I feel is my motivator to bringing it into being. I plumb the depths of the physical shells to find what gives them light from within, and then I put it to paper, canvas or words to share! Within and without. What do you see on the outside, what do you feel on the inside?</p>
      <p>What you see outside your window, is that naught but an illusion or is it reality?  Well, it's your own reality, whatever you determine it to be. </p>
      <p>We could probably debate this, and besides, it's probably all a joke on us anyway! We'll all find out soon enough.</p>
    <p>I'm done with my philosophical musings now! Click on my links, enjoy what you see, email me your thoughts and take my spirit with you as you move through your day.</p>      
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit! </p></td>
