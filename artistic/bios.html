      <p>My  inspirations for my paintings come from within my heart and soul.&nbsp; I went through a profound spiritual change in  my life after my second divorce, in which I rediscovered my art and the spirit  that I am.&nbsp; My paintings are meant to  express the feelings and emotions, both dark and light, and energy that flows  through my spirit, which highlights and expresses my connections to the  Universe.&nbsp; I have been inspired by  thoughts that flow through my mind; a song or an idea will trigger a memory,  and a picture becomes visualized.&nbsp; Books  that I have read have also inspired me, including those by authors Richard Bach  and Neale Walsch to name a few.&nbsp; My artwork  and creativity has been, in a very real sense, the story of my spiritual  transformation and growth.</p>

      <p>I  was born on May 27, 1960 to Gail and  Ralph Molter in White Plains, NY and grew up  in New City, NY.&nbsp; I was introduced to art in high school, and  in fact contemplated an artistic career then.&nbsp;  I went to colleges in Stony Brook, New York, and New Orleans, LA and  ultimately graduated from Mercy College with a BS  degree in Business Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Life  happened, and utilizing my fine art skills became a secondary focus for many  years as I raised my family.&nbsp; I found  creative outlets in many other things, covering a wide range of crafts and  sewing, and for a time was an entrepreneur for my own heirloom quality  christening gown business. I married, had two children, divorced in 1994,  remarried and had my last child in 1996.&nbsp;  It wasn&rsquo;t until after my second divorce in 2001 that I fully  rediscovered my first loves: oil painting and graphite pencil drawing, much of  which has been self-taught. </p>
